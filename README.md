# hello-world
my very first repository

======
Not very sure what this README should say
but hey, this just the Hello World, so
here is a joke I found on internet:

"A programmer was asked what he thought about the Titanic.
He replied: "Should have used double precision. Less chance of having a floating-point error."

lol
